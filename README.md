# Spam Email Classifier

This project is a web application designed to classify emails as either spam or ham (not spam) using a machine learning model. The application is built using Streamlit and utilizes a pre-trained model to provide real-time classification of email content.

## Features

- **Real-Time Classification**: Enter email content and get an immediate classification result.
- **Interactive UI**: Simple and user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier trained on a dataset of spam and ham emails.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Streamlit**: For building the web application.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning model and preprocessing.
- **NLTK**: For text preprocessing.
- **Joblib**: For saving and loading the model and vectorizer.
